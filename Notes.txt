There is a good bit of the functionality not fully implemented
The add entry works, but is sometimes spotty due the handleWhenFitbitContainsDate method
The save data is not fully implemented
Add entry works, but you have to click update to see new results
Everything else should work fine
I missing most of the teting and the bitbucket commits
